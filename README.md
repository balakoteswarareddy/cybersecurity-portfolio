## 👤 About Me

Hi! I'm **Bala Koteswara Reddy Reddymalli**, a final-year B.Tech student (Electronics and Communication Engineering) at RGUKT Nuzvid, specializing in **cybersecurity with a focus on Security Operations Center (SOC) analysis**.

I have hands-on experience investigating security incidents, analyzing logs using **Splunk/Elastic SIEM**, and documenting findings following industry-standard frameworks (**NIST, MITRE ATT&CK**). My goal is to secure an entry-level **SOC Analyst** or **Cybersecurity Analyst** position where I can apply my threat detection and incident response skills.

🔍 **Core Competencies:** Log Analysis, SIEM (Splunk/Elastic), Incident Response, Threat Hunting, Malware Analysis  
🎯 **Interests:** Blue Team Operations, Threat Intelligence, Digital Forensics

## 📂 Security Incident Investigations

I have documented **6 comprehensive security investigations** covering diverse attack scenarios from credential access to malware persistence. Each investigation includes detailed log analysis, IOC extraction, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and remediation recommendations.

| ID | Incident Title | Severity |
|:---|:---------------|:---------|
| **01** | [RDP Brute Force Attack](Reports/IR-2025-001.pdf) | 🔴 High |
| **02** | [Suspicious C2 Network Activity via Typosquatted Binary](Reports/IR-2025-002.pdf) | 🔴 High |
| **03** | [Backdoor Persistence in Linux](Reports/IR-2025-003.pdf) | 🟠 Medium |
| **04** | [Suspicious Activity in Web Server](Reports/IR-2025-004.pdf) | 🔴 High | 
| **05** | [Bruteforce Activity on Linux](Reports/IR-2025-005.pdf) | 🟠 Medium |
| **06** | [Potential Task Scheduler Persistance](Reports/IR-2025-006.pdf) | 🔴 High | 

### 📊 Attack Coverage Matrix

My investigations demonstrate proficiency across multiple attack stages:

- **Initial Access:** Brute Force, Malicious File Execution
- **Execution:** User-initiated malware, Command Line execution
- **Persistence:** Scheduled Tasks, Registry Modifications, Backdoor Accounts
- **Credential Access:** Password Guessing, Credential Dumping
- **Command & Control:** Non-standard Ports, Application Layer Protocols
- **Lateral Movement:** RDP, SSH exploitation
